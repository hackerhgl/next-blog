React JS is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. It is developed and updated daily by Facebook. React JS is very much in demand in building gelled systems like web applications and mobile apps. One of the key features of React JS is that it allows you to break down complex UI components into smaller, reusable pieces. These components can be easily managed and updated, making it easy to maintain and scale your application. React JS also uses a virtual DOM that improves the performance of your application, especially if a component has to be re-rendered whenever it changes. It makes React apps fast and responsive even on low-end devices. React JS also has a large and active community, with plenty of resources and tutorials available for you to learn and use React.
